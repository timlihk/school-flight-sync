## 🚨 Critical Security Issues (Identified but Unresolved)

### Database Security
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Supabase URL and API keys exposed in client-side code
- **No Authentication**: Application lacks user authentication system
- **Over-Permissive Policies**: Database policies allow unrestricted access (`USING (true)`)

### Data Privacy
- **Missing COPPA Compliance**: No parental consent for children's data
- **Missing GDPR Compliance**: No privacy policy, consent mechanisms, or data protection
- **Missing FERPA Compliance**: Educational data not properly protected
- **Unencrypted Sensitive Data**: Personal information stored in plain text

### Technical Debt
- **No Testing Infrastructure**: Zero test coverage
- **Disabled TypeScript Strict Mode**: Safety features turned off
- **Missing Error Boundaries**: No proper error handling
- **Performance Issues**: No code splitting or optimization

### Required Immediate Actions
1. Move database credentials to environment variables
2. Implement user authentication system
3. Add proper database security policies
4. Implement privacy compliance measures
5. Add comprehensive testing suite

**⚠️ WARNING**: This application is NOT suitable for production deployment until these security issues are resolved.
