- [ ] Code splitting by route
- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] Bundle size analysis

---

## üìä Technical Debt

### Items to Address
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remaining ESLint Warnings**: 8 warnings in shadcn/ui files (acceptable)
2. üîÑ **Lazy Loading**: Import statements present but not used
3. üîí **RLS Policies**: Currently using `USING (true)` - consider stricter policies if app scope expands
4. üìù **Type Definitions**: Some `any` types in legacy code could be stricter

---

## üöÄ Quick Wins (< 1 hour each)

These can be done quickly for immediate impact:

1. **Add Favicon** - Professional look
2. **Add Meta Tags** - Better SEO and social sharing
3. **Add Loading Bar** - nprogress or similar
4. **Add Toast Styling** - More polished notifications
5. **Add Keyboard Shortcuts** - Power user features
6. **Add Dark Mode** - User preference support

---

## üìà Metrics to Track

Once implemented, track these metrics:

### User Engagement
- Daily active users
- Average session duration
- Number of flights/transport added per user
- Feature usage (which dialogs opened most)

### Performance
- Page load time (target: < 2s)
- Time to interactive (target: < 3s)
- Bundle size (current: ~800KB, target: < 500KB)
- API response times

### Quality
- Test coverage percentage
- Production error rate
- User-reported bugs
- Build success rate

## üéì Learning Resources

If implementing these features, here are helpful resources:

### PWA Development
- [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/)
- [Workbox (Service Worker Library)](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox)
- [Web.dev PWA Guide](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)

### Testing
- [Vitest Documentation](https://vitest.dev/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react)
- [Testing Best Practices](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library)

## üìù Notes for Future Development

### Architecture Decisions
- **Why React Query?** - Excellent caching, optimistic updates, automatic refetching
- **Why Vitest?** - Fast, Vite-native, great DX
- **Why Supabase?** - PostgreSQL with real-time, authentication, edge functions
- **Why shadcn/ui?** - Customizable, accessible, no vendor lock-in

### Patterns to Follow
1. **Custom Hooks** - All data operations in hooks (`use-flights.ts`, `use-transport.ts`)
2. **TypeScript First** - Strict types, no `any` unless absolutely necessary
3. **Test Coverage** - Every utility function should have tests
4. **Optimistic Updates** - All mutations show immediate feedback
5. **Error Boundaries** - Critical dialogs wrapped in ErrorBoundary

---

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new features:

1. **Create a branch** - `feature/feature-name`
2. **Write tests first** - TDD approach
3. **Update types** - Keep TypeScript definitions current
4. **Run checks** - `npm run check` before committing
5. **Update docs** - Keep README and this file current
6. **Commit format** - Use conventional commits (‚ú® feat:, üêõ fix:, üìö docs:)

---

## üéØ Current Sprint Goals

### Sprint 1 (October 2025)
**Theme:** Mobile Experience

- [ ] PWA Setup (3 hours)
- [ ] Loading States (2 hours)
- [ ] Empty States (1 hour)
- **Total:** ~6 hours

**Success Metrics:**

## üìû Questions or Suggestions?

If you have ideas for improvements or questions about implementation:

1. Open an issue on GitHub
2. Tag with appropriate label (enhancement, question, etc.)
3. Provide context and use cases
4. Suggest implementation approach if you have one

---

**Remember:** Focus on user value first, technical perfection second. Ship features that help parents coordinate school travel more easily! ‚úàÔ∏èüè´
