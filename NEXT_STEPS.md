## 📊 Technical Debt

### Items to Address
1. ⚠️ **Remaining ESLint Warnings**: 8 warnings in shadcn/ui files (acceptable)
2. 🔄 **Lazy Loading**: Import statements present but not used
3. 🔒 **RLS Policies**: Currently using `USING (true)` - consider stricter policies if app scope expands
4. 📝 **Type Definitions**: Some `any` types in legacy code could be stricter

---

## 🚀 Quick Wins (< 1 hour each)

These can be done quickly for immediate impact:

1. **Add Favicon** - Professional look
2. **Add Meta Tags** - Better SEO and social sharing
3. **Add Loading Bar** - nprogress or similar
4. **Add Toast Styling** - More polished notifications
5. **Add Keyboard Shortcuts** - Power user features
6. **Add Dark Mode** - User preference support

---

## 📈 Metrics to Track

Once implemented, track these metrics:

### User Engagement
- Daily active users
- Average session duration
- Number of flights/transport added per user
- Feature usage (which dialogs opened most)

### Performance
- Page load time (target: < 2s)
- Time to interactive (target: < 3s)
- Bundle size (current: ~800KB, target: < 500KB)
- API response times

### Quality
- Test coverage percentage
- Production error rate
- User-reported bugs
- Build success rate

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

### Architecture Decisions
- **Why React Query?** - Excellent caching, optimistic updates, automatic refetching
- **Why Vitest?** - Fast, Vite-native, great DX
- **Why Supabase?** - PostgreSQL with real-time, authentication, edge functions
- **Why shadcn/ui?** - Customizable, accessible, no vendor lock-in

### Patterns to Follow
1. **Custom Hooks** - All data operations in hooks (`use-flights.ts`, `use-transport.ts`)
2. **TypeScript First** - Strict types, no `any` unless absolutely necessary
3. **Test Coverage** - Every utility function should have tests
4. **Optimistic Updates** - All mutations show immediate feedback
5. **Error Boundaries** - Critical dialogs wrapped in ErrorBoundary

---

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding new features:

1. **Create a branch** - `feature/feature-name`
2. **Write tests first** - TDD approach
3. **Update types** - Keep TypeScript definitions current
4. **Run checks** - `npm run check` before committing
5. **Update docs** - Keep README and this file current
6. **Commit format** - Use conventional commits (✨ feat:, 🐛 fix:, 📚 docs:)
